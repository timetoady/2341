            <p>It's an MP3, base quality has no issue with play bascially across all platforms. The wide acceptance of
                the
                type clearly showed.</p>

            <p>Higher quality MP3 still played with equal ability, but did not seem to effect sound greatly on mobile
                platforms. Only PC digital output to a Yamaha receiver made a difference, and it was not large.</p>

            <p>Second song used for verification, with a slightly deeper range than EXTRA MAGIC HOUR. As an MP3, the
                loss of
                clarity was felt more clearly with this one, but that loss seemed pretty consistant across platforms,
                with
                only slight variations in how the sound was conveyed.</p>

            <h4>Assessment</h4>
            <p>Like the MP3, the FLAC was the other format that successfully played across all platforms. However, FLAC
                files seem to have several issues. They were unable to show total play time on any platform from the
                browser, and starting and stopping playback was sometimes a bit sluggish. And although the time would count up, the position wasn't scrollable on any platform. 
                The quality uptick that should be more noticable for a lossless file, but was less apparent on the Android phone, most on the PC.</p>

            <p>OGG was not workable on iOS/iPad 4, on either browser. It did, however, play without issue on Android and
                PC.
                In fact, it probably had the quickest loading time, and the smoothest stops and starts.</p>

            <p>AIFF files did not play on anything but iOS, and then only via Chrome. Safari did not work on all platforms,
                nor did the AIFF file work on any platform but the iPad 4. The usability of this file type on browser
                would seem limited.</p>
