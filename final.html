                        <h5>Song: Evolution</h5>
                        <h5>Album: I am...</h5>
                        <p>During the height of her career, Hamasaki was dubbed the "Empress of J-pop" because of her
                            popularity in Japan and Asia. A noted stylist and lyricist, she has sold over 80 million
                            records, making her the best-selling Japanese solo artist of all time.</p>
                        <p>One of Ayumi's specialties are deep dives into the Electronica/Dance genre. "Evolution" has a
                            fast pace that takes the occasional breath, than gets even faster, building to a blistering intrumental in the latter half
                            before she works into a high-velocity finish. This song and its remixes were regulars for
                            "Dance Dance Revolution" in arcades all over Japan for a reason.</p>

                    <p>Bless4 is a four-sibling group based out of Kawasaki, Japan, but most of it's members were born
                        in Provo, UT while their father attended school, moving back to Japan years later. Accordingly, all members are true bi-langual. The lead vocalalist, Akino, also has a solo
                        career, having sung opening songs to several different
                        animes, starting with "Genesis of Aquarion" in 2005.</p>

                    <p>EXTRA MAGIC HOUR was the opening to the anime adaptation of the light novel series by Shoji Gatoh
                        (of "Full Metal Panic!" fame), "Amagi Brilliant Park." It's cheery, whimsical, celebratory tone
                        stands out as its defining feature, and takes advantage of Akino's ability to put vocal
                        excitement in her songs. She excells at powerful, crisp, straightforward melodies, and emphatic
                        expressions, and EXTRA MAGIC HOUR accentuates this. The song also has an English-language <a
